/**
 * The FlutterEngine class coordinates a single instance of execution for a
 * `FlutterDartProject`.  It may have zero or one `FlutterViewController` at a
 * time, which can be specified via `-setViewController:`.
 * `FlutterViewController`'s `initWithEngine` initializer will automatically call
 * `-setViewController:` for itself.
 *
 * A FlutterEngine can be created independently of a `FlutterViewController` for
 * headless execution.  It can also persist across the lifespan of multiple
 * `FlutterViewController` instances to maintain state and/or asynchronous tasks
 * (such as downloading a large file).
 *
 * Alternatively, you can simply create a new `FlutterViewController` with only a
 * `FlutterDartProject`. That `FlutterViewController` will internally manage its
 * own instance of a FlutterEngine, but will not guarantee survival of the engine
 * beyond the life of the ViewController.
 *
 * A newly initialized FlutterEngine will not actually run a Dart Isolate until
 * either `-runWithEntrypoint:` or `-runWithEntrypoint:libraryURI` is invoked.
 * One of these methods must be invoked before calling `-setViewController:`.

 * an observer for the name `FlutterSemanticsUpdateNotification`.  The `object`
